# SCART to RCA Board

The goal of this project was to make an affordable open-source way to connect SCART cables to PVMs' or Crosspoint Switches. This is designed so
that the cables will be in line, and you can mount multiple of these boards in a row for crosspoint switches. Use with either RCA cables and RCA
female to male BNC adapters or RCA male to BNC female adapters and BNC cables. Use high quality adapters and cables for best results.

#Parts

SCART Connector: K-SCARTX-024, available on Mouser

RCA Connector: PJRAS3X2S01 is available on Mouser and Digikey, but the colors are wrong. Here are the ones I used, a bit cheaper per part:

Mounting hole size is M3, can be used with motherboard standoffs for mounting on MDF or acrylic or something else.

#Price Breakdown
$7.45 per board from OSHPark

$1.00 per RCA connector

$2.50 per SCART connector

Total per board: ~$11

#Version 0.1
This board is untested, I will probably be ordering a few soon after which I will update the version number to 1.0 if everything works out.
